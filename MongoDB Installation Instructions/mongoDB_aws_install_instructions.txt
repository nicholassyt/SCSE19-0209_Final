Install docker by typing the following commands into Ubuntu
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Execute the mongoDB container by typing the following commands into Ubuntu
docker run -d -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name mongoDB mongo:4.2
docker exec -it mongoDB bash
mongo

The user will now be at the mongoDB Shell. The next step is to create basic user accounts.

The admin account:
use admin
db.createUser({user: "admin", pwd: "adminPass321", roles: [{role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin"}]})

The user account:
use DBNAME 
db.createUser({user: "UserName", pwd: "Password", roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "DBNAME"}]})

The database can now be accessed with mongoDB queries by entering the correct user details and IPv4 address.
Ensure that the network the program is executed does not interfere with data flow.
