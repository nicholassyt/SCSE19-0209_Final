MongoDB requires a data directory.
It can be created using the command : md \data\db

C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin is the location of mongod.exe and mongo.exe
Run MongoDB as a windows service or execute mongod.exe to operate the server when required.

Execute mongo.exe for the command line interface to create the relevant collections.
