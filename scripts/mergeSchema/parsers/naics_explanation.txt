What Is a NAICS Code?
A NAICS Code illustrates the business activity of a company. There are 1,057 unique classified industries as of the latest NAICS 2017 revision. NAICS is frequently used by state governments to offer tax incentives or eligibility for contracts based on specific industries.

Businesses can use NAICS codes to find companies within targeted industries for marketing purposes. By identifying the NAICS code of their top clients, they can use this information to reach more customers within that industry.
